## Abstract

This introductory COBOL course helps a novice learn the Structure of COBOL programs, Data types & Variable Handling, Intrinsic Functions, Branching logic and more. The goal of the course is to enable the participant to be able to write basic COBOL programs. Get ready to dive into some actual COBOL!

üé• This course was originally developed by IBM, who have shared it with our nonprofit. IBM is hosting an event called Z Day on Sept 15th, 2020. This free 1-day virtual conference is open to anyone interested in mainframe technologies. You can register for the event here: https://ibmzday.bemyapp.com/2020
